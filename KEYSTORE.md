## Goals:

To have a secure, simple and user-friendly way of storing and managing keypairs
for use by ipfs. As well as the ability to share these keys, encrypt, decrypt,
sign and verify data.

## Planned Implementation
### Storage

Keys will be stored in a directory named `keys` under the `$IPFS_PATH`
directory. Each named keypair will be stored across two files, the private key
in `$NAME` and the public key in `$NAME.pub`. They will be encoded in PEM (or
similar) format, and optionally password encrypted. Upon starting the ipfs daemon,
keys will be lazily loaded as needed. If a given key is password protected, the user
should be prompted for the password at the time of loading the key. The `$IPFS_PATH/keys`
directory should be readable only be the owner, with unix permissions of `700`. Keys
in the directory should be readonly, by the owner `400`.

### Interface
Several additions and modifications will need to be made to the ipfs toolchain to
accomodate the changes. First, the creation of two subcommands `ipfs key` and
`ipfs crypt`:

```

    ipfs key - Interact with ipfs keypairs

SUBCOMMANDS:

    ipfs key gen                  - Generates a new named ipfs keypair
    ipfs key list                 - Lists out all local keypairs
    ipfs key info <key>           - Get information about a given key
	ipfs key rm	<key>             - Delete a given key from your keystore
	ipfs key rename <key> <name>  - Renames a given key
	ipfs key show <key>			  - Print out a given key

	ipfs key send <key> <peer>    - Shares a specified private key with the given peer

    Use 'ipfs key <subcmd> --help' for more information about each command.

DESCRIPTION:

    'ipfs key' is a command used to manage ipfs keypairs.

```

```

	ipfs crypt - Perform cryptographic operations using ipfs keypairs

SUBCOMMANDS:

    ipfs crypt sign <data>          - Generates a signature for the given data with a specified key
    ipfs crypt verify <data> <sig>  - Verify that the given data and signature match
    ipfs crypt encrypt <data>       - Encrypt the given data
    ipfs crypt decrypt <data>       - Decrypt the given data

DESCRIPTION:

	`ipfs crypt` is a command used to perform various cryptographic operations
	using ipfs keypairs, including: signing, verifying, encrypting and decrypting.
```

#### Some subcommands:

##### Key Gen
```

    ipfs key gen - Generate a new ipfs keypair

OPTIONS:

	-t, -type		string		- Specify the type and size of key to generate (i.e. rsa-4096)
	-p, -passphrase string		- Passphrase for encrypting the private key on disk
	-n, -name		string		- Specify a name for the key

DESCRIPTION:

    'ipfs key gen' is a command used to generate new keypairs.
	If any options are not given, the command will go into interactive mode and prompt
	the user for the missing fields.

```
##### Comments:

Similar to ssh's `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` option and interactive prompts.

* * *

##### Key Send
```

    ipfs key send <key> <peer> - Send a keypair to a given peer

OPTIONS:

	-y, -yes		bool		- Yes to the prompt

DESCRIPTION:

    'ipfs key send' is a command used to share keypairs with other trusted users.

	It will first look up the peer specified and print out their information and
	prompt the user "are you sure? [y/n]" before sending the keypair. The target
	peer must be online and dialable in order for the key to be sent.

	Note: while it is still managed through the keystore, ipfs will prevent you from
			sharing your nodes private key with anyone else.

```

##### Comments:

Ensure that the user knows the implications of sending a key.

* * *

##### Crypt Encrypt
```

    ipfs crypt encrypt <data> - Encrypt the given data with a specified key

ARGUMENTS:

	data						- The filename of the data to be encrypted ("-" for stdin)

OPTIONS:

	-k, -key		string		- The name of the key to use for encryption (default: localkey)
	-o, -output		string		- The name of the output file (default: stdout)
	-c, -cipher     string		- The cipher to use for the operation
	-m, -mode		string		- The block cipher mode to use for the operation

DESCRIPTION:

    'ipfs crypt encrypt' is a command used to encypt data so that only holders of a certain
	key can read it.

```

##### Comments:

This should probably just operate on raw data and not on DAGs.

* * *

##### Other Interface Changes

We will also need to make additions to support keys in other commands, these changes are as follows:

- `ipfs add`
    - Support for a `-encrypt-key` option, for block encrypting the file being added with the key
		- also adds an 'encrypted' node above the root unixfs node
	- Support for a `-sign-key` option to attach a signature node above the root unixfs node

- `ipfs block put`
    - Support for a `-encrypt-key` option, for encrypting the block before hashing and storing

- `ipfs object put`
    - Support for a `-encrypt-key` option, for encrypting the object before hashing and storing

- `ipfs name publish`
	- Support for a `-key` option to select which keyspace to publish to

### Code Changes/Additions
An outline of which packages or submodules will be affected.

#### Repo

- add `keystore` concept to repo, load/store keys securely
- needs to understand PEM (or $CHOSEN_FORMAT) encoding

Expected Interface: (very wip)

```
type KeyStore interface {
	// Get a key from the cache
	GetKey(name string) (ci.PrivKey, error)

	// Save a new key into the cache, and write to disk
	StoreKey(name string, key ci.PrivKey) error

	// LoadKey reads the key from its file on disk, and stores it in the cache
	LoadKey(name string, password []byte) error
}
```

Note: Never store passwords as strings, strings cannot be zeroed out after they are used.
using a byte array allows you to write zeroes over the memory so that the users password
does not linger in memory.

#### Unixfs

- new node types, 'encrypted' and 'signed', probably shouldnt be in unixfs, just understood by it
- if new node types are not unixfs nodes, special consideration must be given to the interop

- DagReader needs to be able to access keystore to seamlessly stream encrypted data we have keys for
	- also needs to be able to verify signatures

#### Importer

- DagBuilderHelper needs to be able to encrypt blocks
	- Dag Nodes should be generated like normal, then encrypted, and their parents should
		link to the hash of the encrypted node
- DagBuilderParams should have extra parameters to acommodate creating a DBH that encrypts the blocks

#### New 'Encrypt' package

Should contain code for crypto operations on dags.

Encryption of dags should work by first generating a symmetric key, and using
that key to encrypt all the data. That key should then be encrypted with the
public key chosen and stored in the Encrypted DAG structure.

Note: One option is to simply add it to the key interface.

### Structures
Some tenative mockups (in json) of the new DAG structures for signing and encrypting

Signed DAG:
```
{
	"Links" : [
		{
			"Name":"@content",
			"Hash":"QmTheContent",
		}
	],
	"Data": protobuf{
		"Type":"Signed DAG",
		"Signature": "thesignature",
		"PubKeyID": "QmPubKeyHash",
	}
}
```

Encrypted DAG:
```
{
	"Links" : [
		{
			"Name":"@content",
			"Hash":"QmRawEncryptedDag",
		}
	],
	"Data": protobuf{
		"Type":"Encrypted DAG",
		"PubKeyID": "QmPubKeyHash",
		"Key": "ephemeral symmetric key, encrypted with public key",
	}
}
```
