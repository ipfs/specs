## Introduction

This document defines conventions for how applications can identify available
IPFS gateway, and how IPFS gateway implementations can signal own endpoint to
client applications.

## Specification

There are two ways of hinting user-prefered gateway URL:

- Setting the `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable
- Creating a `gateway` file at a well-known path

Applications SHOULD evaluate these hints in order and stop on the first match:

1. Check if a valid `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable is set
2. Check if a valid `gateway` file is present at one of well-known filesystem paths


### `IPFS_GATEWAY` Environment Variable

When `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable is set, the value MUST be interpreted
as URL of IPFS Gateway application to use.

This variable SHOULD override gateway selection done by all other means, including
internal application configuration.

### The `gateway` Configuration File

Client application SHOULD check if file is present at specific filesystem paths, in order:

1. If `IPFS_PATH` is set, try `$IPFS_PATH/gateway`
2. If `HOME` is set, try `$HOME/.ipfs/gateway`
3. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ipfs/gateway`
4. If `/etc` exists, try `/etc/ipfs/gateway`
5. Try OS-specific paths
   - Windows
     1. `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ipfs/gateway` (local user)
     2. `%APPDATA%/ipfs/gateway` (roaming user)
     3. `%PROGRAMDATA%/ipfs/gateway` (global)
   - macOS
     1. `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ipfs/gateway` (user)
     2. `/Library/Application Support/ipfs/gateway` (global)
   - Linux
     1. `$HOME/.config/ipfs/gateway` (user)
     2. `/etc/ipfs/gateway` (global)

When `gateway` file is present, the file contents MUST be interpreted as line
separated (`\n` or `\r\n`) `text/plain` file.

The first line of `gateway` file MUST be a valid `http://` or `https://` URL.

Implementations that only need one URL SHOULD use the first one and ignore the rest of the file.

### Security

Applications that integrate IPFS support via HTTP gateway:

MUST NOT hard-code non-localhost URL as a default fallback. Instead, SHOULD ask
user to define preferred IPFS gateway using one of methods defined in this
document.

SHOULD either warn user when non-localhost gateway is used for deserialized
responses (warning about the risk of MITM), or (preferred) limit HTTP use
outside of localhost to verifiable response types defined in
:cite[trustless-gateway].

### Privacy and User Control

Applications SHOULD never default to public gateways. Instead, suggest to the
user how to run a local node.

### Compatibility and Testing

Implementers should test against implementations mentioned in :cite[ipip-0280]
as the baseline for making decisions around maximizing interoperability.
