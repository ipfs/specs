## Summary

This IPIP extends the [IPIP-337 HTTP Delegated Routing API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337/) to support announcement of content and peer provider records over `POST` requests.

The work here was originally proposed as part of IPIP-337, and eventually was separated into its own IPIP in order to reduce the scope of original work, while enabling iterative release of the HTTP delegated routing APIs.

## Motivation

The IPFS interaction with DHT includes both read and write operations.
A user can provide records, advertising the presence of content, as well as looking up providers for a given CID.

The specification proposed by
[IPIP-337](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337) offers an idiomatic
first-class support for offloading the lookup portion of this interaction onto
other processes and/or servers.

Following the same motivations that inspired IPIP-337, this document expands the HTTP APIs to also
offload the ability to provide records noto a third-party system.

## Detailed design

HTTP POST support is added
to the [Delegated Content Routing HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/)
at `/routing/v1/providers` and `/routing/v1/peers`, along with complimentary
sections that outline known formats followed by example payload.

## Design rationale

The rationale for the design of `POST` operations closely follows the reasoning
listed in [IPIP-337](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337/).
The design uses a human-readable request/response structure with extensibility in mind.
The specification imposes no restrictions on the schema nor the protocol advertised in provider records.
The hope is that such extensibility will encourage and inspire innovation for better transfer protocols.

In order to reduce barrier for adoption, standard HTTP POST semantics are used,
along with transport-agnostic signature of DAG-CBOR payload representation
similar to the data field in IPNS. This ensures this IPIP does not introduce
any new signature dependency because IPNS records are already supported on
`/routing/v1` since [IPIP-379](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0379/).

### User benefit

Expanding the user benefits listed as part of
[IPIP-337](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337/#user-benefit), in the
context of content routing write operations are typically more expensive than
read operations. They involve book keeping such as TTL, gossip propagation,
etc. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce the burden of advertising
provider records onto the network by means of delegation through simple to use
HTTP APIs.

### Compatibility

#### Backwards Compatibility

##### DHT


Records published through HTTP delegated routing will not benefit from implicit
PeerID identity and libp2p handshake, and must be explicitly signed.

At the time of writing of this IPIP the Amino DHT does not have a concept of
explicit signature. That is why the `POST` APIs proposed here introduce a new
DAG-CBOR data format for specifying provider records, and mechanism for signing
them.


##### Reframe

This API was superseded by `/routing/v1`. See [IPIP-337/Backwards Compatibility](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337/#backwards-compatibility).

#### Forwards Compatibility

[IPIP-337/Forwads Compatibility](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337/#forwards-compatibility) still applies.

The signature format introduced in this IPIP is not tied to HTTP semantics, and
similar to IPNS records, could be propagated by various means, including adding
support for delegated announcement to Amino DHT, where client sends
announcement to HTTP API, and then API backend takes care of sending it
to 20 peers.


### Security

This IPIP reuses semantics of IPNS Record signatures but with a different prefix, to avoid signature reuse attacks.

ID, creation date and TTL facilitate signed mechanism for expiration.

[IPIP-337/Security](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0337/#security) still applies.

### Alternatives

- Reframe (general-purpose RPC) was evaluated, see "Design rationale" section for rationale why it was not selected.
- HTTP `PUT` was evaluated, see [rationale](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/378#discussion_r1476257372) why `POST` was used instead.
