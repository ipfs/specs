## Summary

This IPIP introduces a new gateway extension, named Writable Gateway, that
provides a vendor-agnostic protocol for onboarding arbitrary data to IPFS by
using a regular HTTP `POST` request.

## Motivation

The IPFS implementation Kubo has provided a non-standardized version of a writable
gateway for the past few years. This gateway has received little attention over the
years and there have been requests from users in order to get a 

## Detailed design

## Design rationale

### User benefit

### Compatibility

This IPIP is backwards compatible: it adds a new opt-in functionality for the gateway,
not modifying any existing behaviours.

### Security

Introducing data onboarding via HTTP Gateways opens possibility for data creation
and modification through the gateway. It is likely that not all users will want to
have Writable Gateways enabled, or that they are available to everyone. Therefore,
we recommend that the implementer includes an Authentication method. This
authentication method can be application dependent and is therefore not specified.
