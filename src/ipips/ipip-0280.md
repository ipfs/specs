## Summary

This IPIP aims to create conventions for how applications can identify available IPFS gateway,
and how IPFS gateway implementations can signal own endpoint.

## Motivation

Applications wanting to leverage IPFS Gateways are, without a common
convention, left to invent their own ways of finding a gateway, including naive
approaches such as localhost port scanning.

This IPIP introduces specification that defines how an application wanting to
implement IPFS support can find a local or user-preferred gateways.

## Detailed design

We introduce two ways of hinting user-prefered gateway URL to cover
the majority of runtimes and use cases:

- `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable
- `gateway` file and filesystem paths to look for it

See: :cite[gateway-detection] for details.

## Design rationale

### User benefit

End users can define their prefered gateway once, and benefit from
opportunistic support in applications they use.

Application developers save time as they only need to implement support for
vendor-agnostic convention to be able to read user preferred gateway.

### Compatibility

#### Kubo

Kubo ([>0.15.0](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.15.md#-ipfs_pathgateway-file))
creates a hint file in `$IPFS_PATH/gateway` (default being `$HOME/.ipfs/gateway`, see [kubo#8847](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/8847)).

The file contains a single line being the local HTTP gateway URL. For example: `http://localhost:8080`.

Every time `ipfs daemon` starts, it updates the the content of `$IPFS_PATH/gateway` or creates the file if it doesn't exist.

#### IPFS Chromium

ipfs-chromium uses `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable
([ipfs-chrompium#29](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/issues/29)).

It can be a single URL, or a whitespace-separated URLs to be used as the initial gateway pool.

#### FFMPEG

FFMPEG's libavformat supports both `$HOME/.ipfs/gateway` file and `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable
([ffmpeg.git/commit/f889837](https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/commit/f889837e00d3b2388a24c0a9d075ad62f47da825)).

#### Curl

Curl (>8.4.0, [curl#8805](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/8805)) supports
will try the `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable first, and then look for
`$IPFS_PATH/gateway` or `$HOME/.ipfs/gateway`, if present.

It expects a single URL.
