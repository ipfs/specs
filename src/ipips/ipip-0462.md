## Summary

This IPIP adds gateway support for optional `Ipfs-Path-Affinity` HTTP request header.

## Motivation

Endpoints that implement :cite[trustless-gateway] may receive requests for a
single block, or a CAR request sub-DAG of a biger tree.

While every piece of data that is supposed to be able to be accessed
independently should be advertised on routing system, not every CID is today.
Some providers limit announcements to top-level root CIDs due to time, cost, or
misconfiguration.

What does this mean for the ecosystem? It should adapt and ensure
implementations leverage all infromation provided by the end user.

Over time, both clients and servers should leverage the concept of "affinity".

The introduction of an optional `Ipfs-Path-Affinity` header aims to increase
the success rate of the gateway retrieving internal standalone blocks or byte
ranges, especially if the requested blocks are not announced on routing
systems, but belong to a bigger DAG, and only the root CID of that parent DAG
is announced.

## Detailed design

Introduce `Ipfs-Path-Affinity` HTTP request header to allow HTTP client to
inform gateway about the context of block/CAR request.

Client asking gateway for a block SHOULD provide a hint about the DAG the block
belongs to, if such information is available.

A gateway unable to find providers for internal block should be
able to leverage affinity information sent by client and use CIDs of parent
path segments as additional content routing lookup hints.

## Design rationale

### User benefit

When supported by both client and server:

- Light clients are able to use trustless HTTP gateway endpoints more
  efficiently, resume downloads faster.
- Gateway operators are able to leverage the hint and save resources related to
  provider lookup.
- Content providers are able to implement smarter announcement mechanisms,
  without worrying that some internal blocks are not announced (intentionally or unintentionally).

### Compatibility

This is an optional HTTP header which makes it backward-compatible with
existing ecosystem of HTTP clients and IPFS Gateways.

### Security

The client is in control when the affinity information is sent in the header,
and an implementation SHOULD allow an end user to disable it in context where parent
content path information is considered sensitive information.

Gateway implementation that supports `Ipfs-Path-Affinity` header being present
more than once MUST also set limit (e.g. max 3) to avoid abuse.

### Alternatives

- Why not just an arbitrary identifier the user could use to establish a
  relationship between requests?
  - Requires server to keep state, which breaks or complicates gateway
    deployments with horizontal scaling.
  - Does not help when client is sending requests for different blocks/sub-DAGs
    to different trustless gateways, and none of them has the whole picture,
    and majority of them do not know what is the parent content path.
