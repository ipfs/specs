    <h1>IPFS Standards</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of <em>IPFS Standards</em> is to foster interoperability between independent implementations of
      the IPFS stack by producing Internet-grade specifications and test suites.

      <h3>High-quality open standards</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to fully define implementation behaviour and to empower anyone to build their
        own system that fits into the interplanetary ecosystem without needing to reverse-engineer
        the behavior of other implementations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pitch">
      <h3>Comprehensive test suites</h3>
      <p>
        A specification is only as useful as it is both testable and tested. We are building extensive
        test suites that allow specifications to prove their interoperability and implementations to demonstrate
        their correctness.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pitch">
      <h3>Testing infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        We build tools to support detecting interoperability issues early and often as part of CI/CD pipelines
        and to report on implementation maturity as the stack evolves so that people who build on top of the
        interplanetary stack can know what they can use in production.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pitch">
      <h3>An open governance model</h3>
      <p>
        We guarantee community ownership of the standards, of the standards-production process, and of
        the infrastructure to operate it, in collective pursuit of efficient, transformative, ethical
        technology.

          These documents define the architectural principles that IPFS is built upon, and can be used as tools to evaluate

        <p>
          IPFS Gateway acts as a bridge between traditional HTTP clients and IPFS. Through the gateway, users can download files,
          directories and other IPLD data stored in IPFS as if they were stored in a traditional web server.

        <p>
          The InterPlanetary Naming System (IPNS) is a naming system responsible for creating, reading and updating mutable pointers to data.

          Content routing is the way to determine where to find a given CID on the network;
          specifically, which network peers provide specific CIDs.

          InterPlanetary Improvement Proposals (IPIP) are an <a href="/meta/ipip-process">orderly mechanism</a> to consider
          changes to the IPFS specification. They are not changes to the specification itself,
          but their approval leads to a change in the specification.
