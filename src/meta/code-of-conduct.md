We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting, and free from
intimidation or harassment. Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

:::note

This document was [copied from GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs/community/commits/master/code-of-conduct.md), the
editiors listed are the contributors to that file in chronological order.

:::

## tl;dr

- Be respectful.
- We're here to help: abuse@ipfs.io
- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the IPFS community.
- "Too long, didn't read" is not a valid excuse for not knowing what is in this document.

## Scope

We expect all members of the IPFS community to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all IPFS community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to IPFS affairs.

This policy covers the usage of IPFS public infrastructure, including the IPFS.io HTTP gateways, as well as other IPFS websites, IPFS related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of the IPFS community. It also
applies to behavior in the context of the IPFS Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of IPFS services.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the [IPFS abuse team](#contact-info).

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment; harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Media shared through public infrastructure run by the IPFS team must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content via IPFS public infrastructure if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. You will be solely responsible for any violation of laws or
othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please [contact us](#contact-info) to send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

If you are at an event organized by the IPFS community, contact a _duty officer_ or event staff. To learn more about our procedures handling incidents and reports at events, read the [procedures for in-person events](code-of-conduct-procedures-for-events.md)

## Copyright Violations

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. If you believe any content or other materials available through public IPFS infrastructure violates a copyright held by you and you would like to submit a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar international law, you can submit a notice to the [abuse team](#contact-info) for service.

(We will add a physical mailing address here when we acquire one).

Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requirements.

## Consequences

All content published to public IPFS infrastructure is hosted at the sole discretion of the IPFS team.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the IPFS team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the IPFS team. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

On IRC, let one of the ops know if you think that someone has transgressed against the Code of Conduct. If you would like to be an op and promise to help maintain and abide by the code, please let us know.

## Contact Info

Please contact abuse@ipfs.io if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

We will keep all matters confidential and they will only be shared within the team, with the exception of legal counsel when deemed necessary, or unless given explicit permission by the reporter.

If you prefer, you can contact any of the abuse team members separately. The abuse team is formed by:

- molly@ipfs.io
- dietrich@ipfs.io
- michael@ipfs.io
- ebony@ipfs.io
- hector@ipfs.io

When contacting an individual directly, they will ask for explicit permission to share the details with the rest of the team. When not granted, they will keep details of the matters as confidential as possible (particularly private or identity information) but they may still share broad strokes as necessary to resolve the issue.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
