> This repository contains the specs for the IPFS Protocol and associated
subsystems. Some day we will hopefully transform these specs into RFCs.
For now, they assume a high level of familiarity with the concepts.

## Work In Progress

Warning: this is a work in progress. IPFS is a young system and we want to
get it right. We will continue to evaluate and re-think pieces. At this point,
the IPFS protocol is solid enough to write this spec and produce interoperable
implementations in different languages.

**(This is not done yet, but.)**
I will tag different specs with their stability:

- `wip` this spec is a work-in-progress, it is likely not even complete.
- `draft` this spec is a rough draft and will likely change substantially.
- `stable` this spec is likely to improve, but not change fundamentally.
- `reliable` this spec is believed to be close to final. Minor changes only.
- `permanent` this spec will not change.

Nothing in this spec repository is `permanent` yet. The most important
pieces of IPFS are now `reliable` or `stable`. Many subsystems remain as
`draft`.

Note that, as in many IPFS repositories, most of the work is happening in
[the issues](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/) or in [active pull requests](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pulls/).
Go take a look!

## Collaborating

Suggestions, contributions, criticisms are welcome. Though please make sure to
familiarize yourself deeply with IPFS, the models it adopts, and the principles
it follows.

Please be aware that specs are really hard to design by committee.
Treat this space like you would the workshop of an artist. Please suggest
improvements, but please don't be disappointed if we say no to something.
What we leave out is often more important than what we add in.
