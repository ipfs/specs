# Summary

<!--One paragraph explanation of the IPIP.-->
This is the suggested template for new IPIPs.

# Motivation

AKA Problem Statement

Clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate
to address the problem that the IPIP solves.

# Detailed design

AKA Solution Proposal

Describe the proposed solution and list all changes made to the specs repository.

The resulting specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
interoperable implementations.

## Test fixtures

List relevant CIDs. Describe how implementations can use them to determine
specification compliance. This section can be skipped if IPIP does not deal
with the way IPFS handles content-addressed data.

## Design rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated
the design and why particular design decisions were made.

Provide evidence of rough consensus and working code within the community,
and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

### User benefit

How will end users benefit from this work?

### Compatibility

Explain the upgrade considerations for existing implementations.

### Security

Explain the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.

### Alternatives

Describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.
